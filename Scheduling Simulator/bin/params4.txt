#This tests CPU bounded processes to see how many processes get completed in 1000 seconds.
#This file also makes processes more likely to stay in the ready queue than in the I/O
#service queue. Don't worry about multiple lines of comments since my program is able to
#read multilined comments as long as there's a hashtag as the first character of the line.
